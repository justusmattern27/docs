## Finetuning

Finetuning prices consist of a base fee and costs that are dependent on the training dataset size and number of epochs. 
Below you can find pricing for different models:



| Model | Base Price                           | Token Pricing            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta     | $2                      | $0.002 / 1K tokens    |


If you train for multiple epochs, your token price will be multiplied by your number of training epochs, leading to the following formula for your total price:

`base_price + price_per_thousand_tokens * num_of_thousand_tokens * num_epochs`.
